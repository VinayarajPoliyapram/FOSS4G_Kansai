The resulting huge amount of Earth imagery must be automatically analyzed by AI instead of human eyes. In order to promote the commercialization, we are developing an intelligent system which efficiently collect beneficial information from the tremendous satellite imagery by automatic detection of any kinds of objects and events on the Earth."

    "The perceptron is an intuitive, easy to implement machine learning algorithms which given an input vector x (x1, x2,.., xn) often called input features, outputs either 1 or 0. The perceptron belongs to the category of supervised learning algorithms, more specifically single-layer binary classifier. The perceptron algorithm is about learning the weights for the input features in order to draw linear decision boundary that allows us to discriminate between the two linearly separable classes. In this paper, rather than using it as a classifier, SLP to compute best parameters (weights) which used to multiply the input features in order to provide best accuracy with respect to the ground truth data.
